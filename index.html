      <p>Travelling Luggage  <h2 style="font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size:32px;" class="h3 fontcolorb6a533a1 fontalign-center">Travelling Luggage </h2>
I would strongly suggest the new dashpop American Tourister , 2.5 kg and 41/47 lt (based on the expansion) of having something endurable in any weather and in an affordable price. Therefore, it has a good balance of space and weight.

Otherwise, If you are travelling in period of good weather and you need soft material, then I would also suggest an american tourister (https://www.americantourister.co.uk/summerride-spinner-4-wheels-55cm-breeze-blue/149498-0461.html?cgid=cabin-luggage_soft-cabin-luggage) of approximately 1.8 kg!

The above suggestions are based on whether you need a balance between weight and available space, and you do not want to wait until you receive you luggage ðŸ™‚ !

Regarding travel accessories and specifically hair combs, a tangle teezer is really suggested, it is in travel or regular size and it does not cause any damage to your hair 

As far as hairdryers are concerned, much research is needed. Till now babyliss 6715de was one of the best choices for me for using it for travelling or not.
In the latest additions, Rohnson Electra 2 using a BLDC motor is onboarded. It is compakt. lightweight, strong and it has a nice twist with light indicators on the back based on the level of temperature! I would really appreciate if it would provide a more silky effect on hair but it is very fast in drying.</p>
